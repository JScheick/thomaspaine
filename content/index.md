  <p>
    The <i><b>Thomas Paine National Historical Association</b></i> is the oldest
    historic association for a Founder, <a
    href="/pages/history.html">established in 1884</a>. We are the
    authority on the life, works, and legacy of Paine, and have been
    assisting scholars and authors for decades. This site provides the
    most important articles on Paine, the known and some soon-to-be-known
    new works, and the deattributions we have made. We were founded to
    correct the record on Paine, and rescue it from the negative
    propaganda and slander perpetrated against him by most historians in
    the 19th century. For the most part we have succeeded. Now we are on
    the threshold of making public our findings on Paine's complete works,
    after twenty years of research, and the establishment of the first
    official <a
    href="/pages/the-official-collected-works-of-thomas-paine-project.html">Editorial
    Board for the Collected Works of Thomas Paine</a>, staffed by the
    leading Paine scholars in the world.
