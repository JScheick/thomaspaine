   From the original letter at Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

   Nov. 27th, 1784

   The President has made me acquainted with a Conversation which General
   Washington had with him at their last interview respecting myself, and he
   is desirous that I should communicate to you his wishes, which are that as
   he stands engaged on the General's request to recommend to the assembly,
   as far as lies in his power, their taking into consideration the part I
   have acted during the War, that you would join your assistance with his in
   the measure. &mdash; Having thus, Sir, opened the matter to you in 
   general terms,
   I will take an opportunity at some time convenient to yourself to state it
   to you more fully, as there are many parts in it that are not publicly
   known. I shall have the pleasure of seeing you at the President's today to
   dine, and in the meantime

   I am Sir your Obt Hble Servant

   THOMAS PAINE
