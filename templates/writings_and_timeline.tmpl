      This site provides the most important articles on Paine, the known
      and some soon-to-be-known new works, and the deattributions we have
      made. We were founded to correct the record on Paine, and rescue it
      from the negative propaganda and slander perpetrated against him by
      most historians in the 19th century. For the most part we have
      succeeded. Now we are on the threshold of making public our findings
      on Paine's complete works, after twenty years of research, and the
      establishment of the first official <a href="/pages/collected-works-project.html">Editorial Board for the
        Collected Works of Thomas Paine</a>, staffed by the leading Paine
      scholars in the world.
